1. Find the muChameleon device on Linux
Before do anything, first open a terminal and type the command:
$ ls /dev

Then connect the muChameleon device to the USB port. When the LED begins to flash, the device should be connected. If the LED light is not flashing (either always on or always off), please check the connection.

In the termial, type the following codes:
$ ls /dev
You will find a new device is connected to the computer. Usually the the device is recongnized as 'ttyACM#' (some people also reported that it could be recognized as 'ttyUSB#').If there is only one device connnect, then it should be 'ttyACM0'.

Assuming the device is recognized as 'ttyACM0', try the following commands in the terminal to talk to the device:
$ echo 'led off' > /dev/ttyACM0
$ echo 'led on' > /dev/ttyACM0

Open a new terminal, type the following commands and keep an eye on it:
$ cat /dev/ttyACM0
In another terminal, type:
$ echo 'id' > /dev/ttyACM0
In the monitoring termial, there should display something like 'id ?chameleon'.
